=============================
Cantera Composition Utility Functions 

Charles Reid
August 2013

=============================
There are three methods for specifying
gas compositions:
* String, e.g. "CH4:1.0, O2:1.0"
* Vector, e.g. [0.0, 0.1, 0.75, 1.5, 2.2, 1.0e-5]
* Dict, e.g. d['CH4'] = 1.0; d['O2'] = 1.0

(Note that the dict method is not supported by
Cantera, it is simply a more convenient way
of dealing with compositions.)

We want to be able to do a couple of things:
1. Turn gases into strings/vectors/dicts
2. Turn vectors into dicts and dicts into vectors
3. Turn strings into dicts and dicts into strings



Functions defined in file:

Converting gases to composition vectors, dicts, and strings:
+ convert_gas_to_composition_vector
+ convert_gas_to_composition_dict
+ convert_gas_to_composition_string
+ convert_arrays_to_dict

Converting between composition vectors and dicts:
+ convert_composition_vector_to_dict
+ convert_composition_dict_to_vector

Converting between composition strings and dicts:
+ convert_composition_string_to_dict
+ convert_composition_dict_to_string

Gas mixing:
+ getGasMixture( gases, Xs )
